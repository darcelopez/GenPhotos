DJANGO basic REST client and Image gallery

This is a basic example of using DJANGO to build up an API REST client to fetch free AI generated pictures from a public service on
http://generated.photos, where anyone can get a key to test their service. What the example does is to fecth pictures based on a combined
filter to pick eyes color, hair, etc, then store pics to be able to explore in a very basic way on your own hosting.

Hope you can enjoy as much as i did with it.
